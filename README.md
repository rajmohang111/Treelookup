## `TreeLookup` â€” Breadth-first search using TreeLookup API

user can enter number in the search field.
application will use Treelookup API and breadth first search algorithm to find the path for the searched number.
display the result below the search field.
if path not found, it will display "No search result found" message

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `angular-seed` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `angular-seed` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `angular-seed`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `TreeLookup`

Clone the `angular-seed` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/rajmohang111/Treelookup.git
cd Treelookup
```

### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
